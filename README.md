# Crystal UI

Crystal UI, originally developed by RIP and 00KSpy, is now under new ownership. 
This repository contains their UI source code, available for public use. 
It's worth mentioning that the initial release wasn't made by me; it was leaked by sivy in lunar. 
I've taken the initiative to enhance the codebase, fixing various issues and ensuring better organization and cleanliness.

No there is no working inject/execute in this code I removed it
